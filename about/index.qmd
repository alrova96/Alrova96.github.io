    Hey, I'm happy you are here
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #125F63; font-size: 1em;">
     Thanks for stopping by! 
      <br>
      <br>
       I am a <strong style="color: #F39075;">post-doctoral researcher</strong> at the <strong style="color: #F39075;">Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC)</strong> in the DIGIDRON project under the Momentum CSIC Programme: Develop Your Digital Talent (MMT24-ICMAN-01). My research interests include the application of remote sensing tools (e.g. <strong style="color: #F39075;">drone and satellite imagery</strong>), combined with emerging technologies for digitization and data processing, to address coastal environmental phenomena, with an emphasis on coastal systems and polar regions.
      <br>
      <br>
       I am currently working on several research projects, focusing on <strong style="color: #F39075;">polar research</strong> in penguin colonies on Deception and Livingston Islands (South Shetland Islands), as well as on the development and optimization of <strong style="color: #F39075;">deep learning techniques</strong> to study the spatial distribution and phenology of some of the most vulnerable ecological communities found in coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows and microphytobenthic mudflats.

    My background
</h1>  

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #125F63; font-size: 1em;">
Prior to joining ICMAN-CSIC, I completed a <strong style="color: #F39075;">Bachelor’s degree in Marine Sciences</strong> and a <strong style="color: #F39075;">Master’s degree in Oceanography</strong> at the <strong style="color: #F39075;">University of Cádiz (UCA, Spain)</strong>. In 2017, during the third year of my Bachelor’s program in Marine Sciences at UCA, I began collaborating on scientific research with <strong style="color: #F39075;">Dr. Laura del Río</strong> in the Department of Earth Sciences. Later, I received a <strong style="color: #F39075;">Collaboration Scholarship</strong> to fund my Master’s thesis project under the supervision of <strong style="color: #F39075;">Professor Dr. Luis Barbero</strong>. For this project, I used drone technology with thermal sensors to detect submarine groundwater discharges in coastal areas.
<br>
      <br>
In 2020, I began my scientific career at the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC, Spain), where I pursued a <strong style="color: #F39075;">PhD focused on developing remote sensing tools and using sensors onboard drones to study coastal environmental processes</strong>. Funded by the <strong style="color: #F39075;">PhD Fellowship for University Staff Training (FPU, ref: FPU19/04557)</strong>, I worked under <strong style="color: #F39075;">Dr. Antonio Tovar-Sánchez and Dr. Gabriel Navarro</strong>. During this time, I specialized in researching various marine ecosystems and characterizing diverse coastal environmental processes, such as seagrass meadows, penguin colonies, and algal blooms. As a result, I participated in <strong style="color: #F39075;">six research projects</strong>, including two polar projects (PiMetAn and DICHOSO), and <strong style="color: #F39075;">published 17 peer-reviewed articles</strong>, ten of which I was the first author, in leading journals in the fields of Remote Sensing, Oceanography, and Multidisciplinary Sciences. I completed <strong style="color: #F39075;">my PhD in July 2024</strong>, graduating with the highest honors, <strong style="color: #F39075;">summa cum laude</strong>.
<br>
      <br>
I also shared my work with a broader audience at national and international conferences and expanded my training through <strong style="color: #F39075;">three research stays abroad</strong>. From February to June 2022, at the <strong style="color: #F39075;">University of Malta</strong>, under the supervision of <strong style="color: #F39075;">Dr. Adam Gauci</strong>, I enhanced my Python programming skills specifically for drone operations over aquatic surfaces. Later, from October to November 2022, I was at the <strong style="color: #F39075;">University of Nantes</strong>, working with <strong style="color: #F39075;">Dr. Laurent Barillé</strong> on multispectral monitoring of oyster farming areas and the study of microphytobenthos in estuarine systems. Finally, from September 2023 to February 2024, I developed Python techniques to improve marine optics algorithms for water quality studies using multispectral drone sensors at the <strong style="color: #F39075;">University of Maryland</strong>. This research stay was funded by a <strong style="color: #F39075;">Fulbright scholarship</strong> and supervised by <strong style="color: #F39075;">Dr. Greg Silsbe</strong>.
<br>
      <br>
More recently, at the beginning of 2025, I had the privilege of participating in my first <strong style="color: #F39075;">Antarctic campaign</strong> thanks to the <strong style="color: #F39075;">DICHOSO project</strong>. I embarked on the research vessel BIO Hespérides to cross the Drake Passage from Ushuaia (Argentina) until we arrived on January 9th at the Spanish Antarctic Base Gabriel de Castilla on Deception Island (South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica). Once there, we assessed the <strong style="color: #F39075;">role of the island’s volcanic nature and the chinstrap penguin colonies in greenhouse gas emissions</strong>, either directly into the atmosphere or through the Southern Ocean. Then, on February 9th, we left the base to begin the campaign aboard the research vessel B/O Sarmiento de Gamboa between Deception and Livingston Islands, working with oceanographic instruments to collect water samples from both surface and deeper layers. Finally, after crossing the Drake Passage once again, we disembarked on February 24th in Punta Arenas (Chile), bringing to a close one of the most enriching and fascinating experiences of my professional career and my life. Now, I am preparing to embark on a new oceanographic campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, thanks to the <strong style="color: #F39075;">ESA Advanced Ocean Synergy Training Course</strong>, in which I will participate between April and June 2025.
